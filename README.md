Here you find tomography and FIB/SEM analysis as well as imaging software I wrote during my stay in the NanoGeoScience group at the University of Copenhagen. 
The programs should run on every computer with a few packages, such as OpenCV and pywt, required for python.

In some cases the code has been provided or inspired by other peoples work. Those contributions are credited in the according files.
